# Groundwater Database Management

This is the collection of automatic groundwater database update code. It utilize SQL, Python, and QGIS. This is part of the study project during my Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD) in program Groundwater and Global Change: Impacts and Adaptation (GroundwatCH). The study project is done in the Institute of Groundwater, Hysro Science and Engineering, Technische Universit√§t Dresden, Germany. 

In this Groundwater databse, *PostgreSQL* is used for the relational database system. This is used as it is open-source, wasy to handle, and also compatible with ArcGIS Pro. The databse is created using Structured Query Language (SQL) first in the  *SQL Shell* (PostgreSQL Command Line) and then established further using *Python* package *psycopg2*.
